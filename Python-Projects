#Harmonic series and square root of numbers - Newton's method - Raphson

Example: Paying a specific tax rate based on income level:
By way of nested if statements
If my income is zero, my tax rate is also zero. Otherwise, if it is less than 8.925 (i.e. the income is not negative) - the tax rate should be 10%, as a decimal number it is 0.1, otherwise I have to check if it is smaller than 36.250 and in the same way I write these conditions inside if else.
Hey, we are increasing the indentation level. In order to use fewer characters, we simplify the program.
Question: What is incorrect in the summary calculations for calculating the tax rate?

#Several applications of the Harmony series
In general, the harmony series is as follows:
For this range, I add 1/i to the current total each time.
and finally prints the total in the output. In fact, we are approximating here.
Because Ln is from the math library, we must first import this library.
#The second application of the Harmony series:
Calculating the roots of numbers: turns the problem of finding roots into the problem of finding roots

#Newton-Raphson method
The goal is to find the root of the function (curve). Idea: Newton-Raphson method
Here is my function: f(x) - I start from an arbitrary point - at that point (slope) and then I update t - again at this point I calculate the derivative and based on... I will get closer as you can see in the picture above.
I want to know where the desired function is zero.
That is, the first time I took t to be zero.
The more I repeat this method, the closer I am to the result. I continue up to 15 decimal places.
To increase the accuracy, I calculate EPSILON = 1e-15.
First, I start with t=c until this difference is while abs(t-c/t) > (EPSILON * t) and I do that update.
The new t becomes the previous t plus c/t divided by 2:
